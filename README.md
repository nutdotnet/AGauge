# AGauge Classic
![Screenshot of the original AGauge demo form by A. J. Bauer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nutdotnet/AGauge/main/AGaugeApp/screenshot.bmp)

A customizable, inheritable .Net Framework WinForms Control based on the [initial tutorial](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/17559/A-fast-and-performing-gauge) by A.J.Bauer, and additional enhancements by [Code Artist](http://www.codearteng.com/2012/08/agauge-winforms-gauge-control.html) and others. This project is being further maintained by the NUTDotNet organization to support [WinNUT](https://github.com/nutdotnet/WinNUT-Client/) and hopefully others who wish to continue using this control. This project is intended to be kept going with bug fixes and no major changes are planned. For a newer iteration of AGauge, take a look at Code Artist's [WinForm Gauge](https://winformgauge.codearteng.com/).
